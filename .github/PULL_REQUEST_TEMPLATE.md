Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Please **do not** submit a pull request on GitHub.  This repository is
an automated mirror, and I don't develop using GitHub's platform.

Instead, either

- publish a branch somewhere (a GitHub fork is fine), and e-mail
  <spwhitton@spwhitton.name> asking me to merge your branch, possibly
  using git-request-pull(1)

- prepare patches with git-format-patch(1), and send them to
  <spwhitton@spwhitton.name>, probably using git-send-email(1)
